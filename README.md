# Lumos - CGPA Calculator

## Overview

Lumos is my first full stack web application. It is an intuitive CGPA calculator built to eliminate the redundant task of manually calculating and tracking GPAs.

* Upload your grades subject-wise and let the calculator take care of the rest.
* Get detailed visualizations of the grades both subject-wise and semester-wise.

## Tech Stack

* **React + Vite** – Frontend framework
* **Tailwind CSS** – For faster and modern styling
* **Firebase** – For authentication and database
* **Chart.js** – For graph visualizations

## Features

* **Simple sign-in with Google** – Secured using Firebase authentication
* **Calculator Page** – Enter subject names, credits, and grades to compute your GPA; save it if needed
* **Stats Page** – View visualizations of saved GPAs, including semester-wise and overall summaries
* **Dark & Light Mode** – Toggle between themes for better user experience

## Learning Outcomes

* Gained initial exposure to full stack development, state management, and data storage
* Learned how to implement and manage dark and light mode states across the application
* Understood how to integrate and interact with third-party cloud services like Firebase
* Learned the process of hosting and deploying web applications using Vercel
* Applied a component-based development approach to create reusable UI elements and handle data extraction, storage, and processing
* Applied CSS grids instead of tables which was challenging
